#AzCops — Description options (pick the tone you want)

One-liner (CLI / README):
AzCops is a lightweight Azure cost-optimization tool that scans your subscription(s) and surfaces actionable savings recommendations.

Slightly longer (product blurb):
AzCops helps you reduce Azure spend by analyzing resource usage and configuration, then generating prioritized recommendations (rightsizing, idle resources, storage tiering, reservation coverage, and policy hygiene) with estimated savings and next steps.

Enterprise tone:
AzCops is an Azure FinOps assistant that continuously evaluates cost drivers across subscriptions, flags waste and underutilization, and produces auditable, policy-aligned optimization guidance for engineering and finance teams.

Tagline ideas:

“Find waste. Cut spend. Stay compliant.”
“Actionable Azure savings, in minutes.”
“FinOps signals for Azure engineers.”
Tell me what AzCops is (CLI, web app, or extension) and your target audience (engineers vs FinOps), and I’ll tailor this into a final “About”, “Short description (Marketplace)”, and “README intro” set.
